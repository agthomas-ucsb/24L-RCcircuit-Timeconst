# 24L-RCcircuit-Timeconst
A curve fitting analysis tool for finding the time constant and generating figures of an RC circuit from a waveforms CSV

To use, run main.py and select your CSV file. After a moment it will return a list of timeconst measurements for every charge/discharge detected in the dataset.

Running FigureGen.py and selecting your CSV file prompts you to select a number which it neatly creates a figure of for you.
